15% of country’s total population experience homelessness in India. In which 89% of the homeless women are illiterate. The women do not get any money for food or pocket expenses and have to rely on their pensions for all their needs. 68% of the women do not receive pensions while 58% do not hold ration card. Single women are a separate category that needs attention in terms of services and policies as they are often the most vulnerable. There are several reasons that may cause a person to end up living on the streets or in a shelter, orphanages, NGOs etc., 40% of the country’s homeless make no mention of them at all. 

 There are NGOs and political groups that are working with and for the destitute women. However, there is no attempt at organizing these women into Self Help Groups. Many of these organizations often lack funding which run on donations and are in constant need of resources to sustain and continue providing aid to needy.

 Code for Change team is building a transparent platform to bring the NGOs, Small Scale Industries, Large Organizations with CSR funding etc., together to support homeless women with the regular donation method and also self-funding by creating employment and training to the homeless women. Our platform will majorly focus on providing online training using external resources and helps to provide the outreach for the homeless to get employed or the organization to raise funds for themselves using these trainings so that they don’t totally depend on external funding. The combined factors of illiteracy, old age and language limitation makes it difficult for the homeless women to find many work option. Our platform will provide an opportunity to these women to overcome these factors.
